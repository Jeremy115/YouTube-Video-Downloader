If you want to make changes to the program with the current state you can. 
The license is MIT. You have full permission to do as you please with this code.  


A lot of the times YouTube will detect your request as a bot so may have to wait a while to download. 
Sometimes you can spam the download button and it will just eventually go through. 
I recommend downloading and not attempting to redownload the video as multple times it will be flagged and may have issues downloading other videos. 
















If you are wanting to create your own exe with modifications:  

Activate environment. 
#WINDOWS ONLY
source env\Scripts\activate
-Here you can add your own packages into the virtual environment. 



If you want want to extract everything into a exe. 

From the virtual environment run the auto-py-to-exe.
WARNING - if you do not use the Virtual environment then it will not work. So use the source env\Scripts\activate above. 

command: 
auto-py-to-exe



I recommend using the exeDownload folder to move everything to.
