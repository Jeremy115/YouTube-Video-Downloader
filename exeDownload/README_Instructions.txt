IF YOU WANT TO ALLOW WINDOWS TO INSTALL THE .rar OR .zip AND NOT FLAG THE DOWNLOAD AS A VIRUS HERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS: 

DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
ANYTIME YOU INSTALL SOMETHING ON THE ENTERENET IT IS A RISK!


  1. KEEP IN MIND TO TURN THIS BUTTON BACK ON SO DO NOT CLOSE THE WINDOW WHEN YOU GET HERE:
      Settings> Update and Security> Windows Security> Open Windows Security > 
      > Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection settings > TURN OFF REAL-TIME Protection. 

  2. Download the .rar or .zip folder located in /exeDownload/

  3. Make a folder somewhere on your computer like c:/YouTubeVideoDownloader or d:/YouTubeVideDownloader and put the .rar or .zip file in. 

  4. Put the .zip or .rar file in the newly created folder location on your computer and extract it. 

  5. Go back to > Virus & threat protection settings > Exclusions (Add or remove exclusions) > Add an exclusion > file 
        Choose the file location of the newly create folder from step 3 - E.x C:\YouTube_Downloader
        Go into the folder until you see these files: 

          _internal
          Images
          savedFileLocation
          themes
          YouTube_Downloader

        you want to choose the YouTube_Downloader file and click open at the bottom right. 


  6. TURN BACK ON REAL-TIME PROTECTION located Settings> Update and Security> Windows Security> Open Windows Security 
                > Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection settings > TURN ON REAL-TIME Protection.

  7. In the folder of the newly created file, locate the YouTube_Downloader file(.exe) and right click it and create a shortcut and place that on your desktop for ease of access. 

  8. NOW you should be able to run the shortcut but windows may warn you about this file being a virus, while I have added nothing malicous own my own its your decision beyond this point. 
      TO Continue - Run anyway and now you can use the youtube downloader. You can choose file locations you wish to store the files in but default will be the desktop.
